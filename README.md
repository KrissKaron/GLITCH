# The GLITCH
### What is it?
A solo project meant to generate the golden goose egg everyone in the financial district has been chasing - an algorithm that returns at least 1% daily profit upon trading 100% equity.
The approximate formula for the ROI is X*(nË†d), where "X" is the initial sum, "n" is the percent daily profit, and "d" is the number of days the algorithm is running.
For "n" = 1.01 (1%) and "d" = 365, we're looking at a ROI of 37.78x of the invested initial sum. 

### Methods and technologies used
CSV files seem to provide enough structure for this project. 
Multiple APIs have been constructed for the various data/news sources required.
Following the idea of implementing an amplitude, period and decay function to emulate the pulse of BTC, Reinforcement Learning and/or Deep Learning methods are being employed.

### Status
If you can read this, then the code you are seeing is by no means a profitable one. 
The purpose of publishing this repo is to showcase skill and passion, for data science, high frequency trading and quant.
